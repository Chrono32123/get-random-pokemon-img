This python script was written to re-create Nutty's "Who's that Pokemon" ad break but using a different set of apps.
The idea isn't original but hopefully this implementation is.

BEFORE running this script for the first time:
1. Install Python 3.10 (that's what version I used when I wrote it but older versions MIGHT work?)
2. Install the necessary python dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt

If you're using MixItUp:
    Be sure you import the commands correctly and setup the other assets you might need.
    I have included the GIFs and still image I made of the background so that it would just work BUT you might need to make further adjustments.

I'm offering this with very limited support. I won't walk you through installing MixItUp or Python. Google has the answers you need for that.

If there's something in the code or MIU commands that could be better feel free to let me know.
