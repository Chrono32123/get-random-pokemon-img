This python script was written to re-create Nutty's "Who's that Pokemon" ad break but using a different set of apps.
The idea isn't original but hopefully this implementation is.

BEFORE running this script for the first time:
1. Install Python 3.10 (that's what version I used when I wrote it but older versions MIGHT work?)
2. Install the necessary python dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Update the cache folder location for the script on line 13 of getPokemonImg.py
    Skipping this step will cause you a headache...
    Running the script in MixItUp makes the os.getcwd() command point to the MixItUp appData folder instead of this script folder.

If you're using MixItUp:
    Be sure you import the commands correctly and setup the other assets you might need.
    I have included the video files and GIF needed for the background. You will need to point the mix it up command to wherever you pulled/downloaded this repo to.

I'm offering this with very limited support. I won't walk you through installing MixItUp or Python. Google has the answers you need for that.

If there's something in the code or MIU commands that could be better feel free to let me know.
